# FPGA ALU with ROM Extension

Individual project.  
Designed and implemented an FPGA-based Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using VHDL.  
The project consists of two parts: a standalone ALU and an extended ROM-driven design.

---

## Overview
- **Skills Developed:** RTL design in VHDL, use of sequential statements (if & case), and testbench-based verification with waveform analysis.
- **Features:**  
  4-bit ALU supporting addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
  Warning logic for overflow, negative results, and division by zero.  
  Extended version includes ROM-driven inputs and controlled operation sequencing.
- **Technology:** Xilinx Vivado, Zybo Z7 (Zynq-7000), Zynq Processing System (ARM Cortex-A9).
- **Simulation:** Functional verification performed using VHDL testbenches and waveform analysis.
- **Language:** VHDL
