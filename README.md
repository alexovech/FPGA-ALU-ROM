# FPGA ALU with ROM Extension

Individual project. 
Designed and implemented an FPGA-based Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using VHDL.
The project was developed in two stages, progressing from a standalone ALU to an extended ROM-driven design integrated with the Zynq-7000 Processing System on the Zybo Z7 board.

## Overview

- **Full project description:**  
  The project demonstrates the design, verification, and hardware implementation of a 4-bit ALU on FPGA, followed by a system-level extension using ROM-based operand sequencing and PS/PL interaction.

- **Skills Developed:**  
  RTL design in VHDL, modular hardware architecture, testbench-based verification, FPGA debugging, overflow and exception handling, and structured version control using GitHub.

- **Features:**  
  4-bit ALU supporting addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
  Warning logic for overflow, negative results, and division by zero.  
  Extended version includes ROM-driven inputs and controlled operation sequencing.

- **Technology:**  
  VHDL, Xilinx Vivado, Zybo Z7 (Zynq-7000), Vivado IP Integrator, Zynq Processing System (ARM Cortex-A9).

- **Simulation:**  
  Functional verification performed using dedicated VHDL testbenches with waveform analysis for both standalone and ROM-based designs.

- **Language:**  
  VHDL
