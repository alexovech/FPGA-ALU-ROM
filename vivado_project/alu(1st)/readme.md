# How to open the project

This directory contains a standalone Vivado project.


1. Copy the entire `project_alu` directory to a local location on your computer.
2. Open the Vivado project using the file: `project_alu.xpr`
3. Vivado will automatically load all required design sources.
All RTL source files and the testbench are located in: `project_alu.srcs/`

If Vivado prompts to regenerate output products, confirm the action.
No generated files (runs, cache, bitstream) are included in this directory.
