## How to open the project

This repository contains a Vivado project for the Zybo Z7 (Zynq-7000).

- Open the project using `clk_arm_based.xpr` in Vivado.
- All RTL sources and the Block Design are located in `clk_arm_based.srcs/`.
- Generated files (runs, cache, bitstream) are not included and can be regenerated if needed.

The project implements a ROM-driven ALU system using custom VHDL modules and Zynq PS/PL integration.
